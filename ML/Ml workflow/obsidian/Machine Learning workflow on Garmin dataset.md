Below is your updated and enhanced ML workflow that incorporates additional techniques for better analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and interpretability.tep 1: Data Inspection

1. Initial Dataset Exploration:
2. - Objective: Understand the structure of the dataset and identify potential data quality issues.
    - Used:
    - - data.info() to inspect the dataset's structure, including column names, data types, and non-null counts.
        - data.describe() to summarize numerical features and detect potential outliers or skewed distributions.
    - Observed:
    - - Non-numeric columns like durations (Temps Ã©coulÃ©, DurÃ©e) stored as strings.
        - Features like Calories and Distance appeared relevant but required further inspection for outliers or flawed entries.
        - Missing values and placeholders like "--" were present in some columns.
3. Target Variable Analysis:
4. - Analyzed the target variable (Calories):
    - - Checked its distribution using histograms to detect skewness.
        - Used boxplots to compare Calories across categorical variables like Type d'activitÃ© to understand differences across activity types.
5. Key Observations:
6. - Derived features like Speed_kmh and Steps_Per_Meter showed extreme or invalid values (e.g., inf, very large or small numbers).
    - Missing values, incorrect data types, and placeholders required cleaning.
    - Relationships between features and the target variable needed deeper exploration.

---

### Step 2: [[Data Cleaning]]

1. Missing Value Handling:
2. - Replaced invalid placeholders (e.g., "--") with NaN to handle them systematically.
    - Numerical features: Imputed missing values using the median to avoid skewing the data.
    - Categorical features: Imputed missing values with the mode or a new "Unknown" category for clarity.
    - Dropped columns with more than 80% missing values as they added little value to the analysis.
3. Conversion of Non-Numeric Columns:
4. - Converted duration columns (e.g., Temps Ã©coulÃ©, DurÃ©e) into numerical formats (seconds) using a custom function.
    - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features like Type d'activitÃ© to make them ML-ready.
5. Fixing Derived Features:
6. - Corrected flawed calculations in features like Speed_kmh and Steps_Per_Meter by:
    - - Adding small constants (1e-5) to denominators to prevent division by zero.
        - Ensuring consistent units (e.g., converting seconds to hours for Speed_kmh).
7. Time-Based Feature Extraction:
8. - Converted Date to datetime format and derived:
    - - DayOfWeek (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday).
        - IsWeekend (binary feature for weekends).
        - Month for seasonal analysis.

---

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis ([[EDA]])

1. Exploring Feature Distributions:
2. - Used histograms and boxplots to analyze the distributions of features like Calories, Distance, and Speed_kmh.
    - Detected:
    - - Skewed distributions in features like Calories_Per_Minute and Effort_Level.
        - Significant outliers in Speed_kmh and Steps_Per_Meter.
3. Correlation Analysis:
4. - Plotted a correlation heatmap to identify relationships:
    - - Strong correlations: Distance â†” Calories, FrÃ©quence cardiaque moyenne â†” FrÃ©quence cardiaque maximale.
        - Weak correlations: Features like Altitude minimale had little predictive value for Calories.
5. Clustering Analysis:
6. - Applied K-Means clustering to group similar activities based on Distance, Effort_Level, and Speed_kmh.
    - Visualized clusters using scatter plots to understand patterns in the data.
7. Multicollinearity Check:
8. - Used Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity among features.
    - Combined or dropped features with high VIF scores to improve model interpretability and performance.Step 4: Feature Engineering
9. Derived New Features:
10. - Speed_kmh: Calculated as Distance / Temps Ã©coulÃ© (converted to hours) to represent activity speed.
    - Calories_Per_Minute: Derived as Calories / Temps Ã©coulÃ© (in minutes) to indicate calorie burn efficiency.
    - Steps_Per_Meter: Calculated as Pas / Distance to measure step efficiency.
    - Effort_Level: Calculated as (FrÃ©quence cardiaque moyenne / FrÃ©quence cardiaque maximale) * 100 to represent workout intensity.
11. Simplified Features:
12. - Removed redundant features like Allure moyenne and Meilleure allure, replacing them with Speed_kmh.
13. Time-Based Features:
14. - Extracted temporal insights:
    - - DayOfWeek: Encoded days of the week numerically (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday).
        - IsWeekend: Created a binary flag for weekend activities.
        - Month: Extracted the month to study seasonal trends in activities.
15. Polynomial Features:
16. - Introduced interaction terms between features using PolynomialFeatures, such as:
    - - Speed_kmh * Effort_Level to capture combined effects of speed and effort.
        - Calories_Per_Minute ** 2 to model potential quadratic relationships.
17. [[Dimensionality Reduction]] (PCA):
18. - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while retaining most of the variance, especially for high-dimensional data.

### Step 5: Outlier Detection and Removal

1. Detected Outliers:
2. - Used boxplots and calculated Interquartile Range (IQR) to flag extreme values in key features:
    - - Speed_kmh: Capped between ~3.19 and ~15.38.
        - Calories_Per_Minute: Limited between ~3.33 and ~14.44.
        - Steps_Per_Meter: Restricted between ~0.65 and ~1.18.
3. Removed Outliers:
4. - Dropped rows where values fell outside the acceptable bounds for any of the key features.
5. Capped Remaining Extremes:
6. - Applied capping with clip() to control edge cases without removing additional rows:
    - - For example, capped Speed_kmh at 15.38 km/h for reasonable upper bounds.
7. Rechecked Distributions:
8. - Plotted the cleaned features to ensure all extreme values were handled appropriately.

---

### Step 6: Train-Test Split

1. Defined Features and Target:
2. - Set Calories as the target variable (y).
    - Used all relevant numerical and engineered features as predictors (X), dropping irrelevant or redundant columns like Titre and Date.
3. Performed Train-Test Split:
4. - Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets using train_test_split with a fixed random seed (random_state=42) for reproducibility.
5. Applied Cross-Validation:
6. - Used 5-Fold Cross-Validation on the training data to:
    - - Evaluate model performance on multiple splits.
        - Ensure the model generalizes well and doesnâ€™t overfit a single train-test split.

### Step 7: Model Training

1. Baseline Models:
2. - Linear Regression:
    - - Trained as a baseline model to check for linear relationships between features and the target.
        - Performed poorly on test data due to non-linear relationships and noise in the dataset.
    - Decision Tree:
    - - Captured non-linear relationships but overfit the training data (RÂ² = 1.0) and showed limited generalization on test data.
    - Random Forest:
    - - Best performer among baseline models due to its ability to handle noise and non-linear relationships.
        - Achieved lower RMSE and MAE compared to other models.
3. Advanced Models:
4. - Trained Gradient Boosting Models:
    - - XGBoost and LightGBM offered improved performance over Random Forest, particularly on test data.
        - Tuned hyperparameters like learning_rate, max_depth, and n_estimators for optimal results.
    - Stacking Models:
    - - Combined predictions from multiple models (e.g., Random Forest + Linear Regression) using a Stacking Regressor to improve overall accuracy.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
6. - Used GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters:
    - - Random Forest: Tuned n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, etc.
        - XGBoost: Tuned learning_rate, max_depth, subsample, and colsample_bytree.

### Step 8: Model Evaluation and Comparison

1. Evaluation Metrics:
2. - RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination): Measured how well the model explains variance in the target.
    - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalized large prediction errors.
    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measured the average magnitude of prediction errors.
3. Model Performance Summary:
4. - Linear Regression:
    - - Poor performance with negative RÂ² on test data due to its inability to handle non-linear relationships.
    - Decision Tree:
    - - Overfit the training data but moderately generalized on test data.
    - Random Forest:
    - - Best performer among all baseline models, balancing accuracy and robustness to noise.
    - XGBoost/LightGBM:
    - - Gradient Boosting Models achieved the best results, outperforming Random Forest on both training and test data.
5. Feature Importance Analysis:
6. - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models provided feature importance scores to identify the most influential features (e.g., Distance, Effort_Level, Speed_kmh).
7. Interpretability Tools:
8. - Used SHAP values to explain the contributions of individual features to model predictions.
    - Plotted Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to visualize the effect of key features like Speed_kmh and Effort_Level on Calories.
