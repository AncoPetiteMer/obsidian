        "\n",
        "- **prepare_data():**  \n",
        "  Iterates through the documents to convert tokenized words into bag-of-words vectors, maps intent tags to indices, and stores the data as numpy arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **train_model(batch_size, lr, epochs):**  \n",
        "  Converts the training data into PyTorch tensors, creates a DataLoader for batch processing, initializes the `ChatbotModel`, and trains the network using the AdamW optimizer with CrossEntropyLoss. It also tracks and visualizes the training loss over epochs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **save_model(model_path, dimensions_path):**  \n",
        "  Saves the trained model’s weights, input/output dimensions, vocabulary, and intent list to ensure consistent reloading.\n",

        "  Processes incoming messages by tokenizing, converting them to a bag-of-words vector, and running the data through the model to predict the most likely intent. If a function mapping exists for the predicted intent, it executes the corresponding external action, then returns a random associated response.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Additional Function: get_stocks\n",
        "\n",
        "This supplementary function demonstrates the system’s extensibility by randomly selecting and displaying three stock symbols from a predefined list. It is linked to an intent (e.g., “stocks”) via the function mappings, exemplifying how the chatbot can perform external actions based on recognized intents.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 6. Main Execution Block\n",
        "\n",
        "The codebase illustrates two distinct deployment approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Training & Saving:**  \n",
        "   - Initializes the `ChatbotAssistant`, parses and prepares the data, trains the model, and saves both the model and its related metadata (dimensions, vocabulary, intents) for future use.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loading & Interactive Session:**  \n",
        "   - Reloads a pre-trained model and enters an interactive mode where users can input messages. The chatbot processes each message in real-time, returning dynamic responses, with the session terminating when the user inputs `/quit`.\n",
